component:
returns react element

class component: (stateful component)
a. render function (comes from component base class) must have the return statement to return react element
b. in order to get the element, React JS creates instance of the class component first and then invokes render function
NOTE: there is a Component OBJECT here. this keyword is must to access anything inside the component (data member of functional member). this refers to the current instance (ie. the current instance is the context)
c. you can avail state in class component
d. you can avail lifecycle methods in class component

functional component: (Presentational/stateless component)
a. it's a function itself...so just have a return statement to return react element
b. just calling the function returns the element within
NOTE: there is no question of any Component OBJECT here. Hence 'this' keyword has no meaning (i.e. context)
c. you can NOT avail state in class component
d. you can NOT avail lifecycle methods in class component

LifeCycle events and hooks (methods):

stages:
a. creation and mounting
	a. constructor is executed first when the object of class component is created
	constructor(props)
        super(props)
	//this.state={}
	//this.handler = this.handler.bind(this)

	handler=()=>{}
	state = {
	}
	
	b. getDerivedStateFromProps executed: use it to set the state based on the received props value (from parent)
	c. render method gets invoked...that creates the React element for the very first time..thus this element becomes part of the VDOM
        NOTE: all child compoments also will be rendered...
	d. componentDidMount() gets invoked...that places the component element in the Actual DOM

b. updation
	Note: ctor---NOT called
	a. getDerivedStateFromProps executed: use it to set the state based on the received props value (from parent)
	b. shouldComponentUpdate(newProps) gets invoked....
	c. render. Should return
		1. React elements
		2. Arrays and fragments
		3. Portals
		4. string/numbers: text node
		5. boolean value: diplays nothing
	Note: it should be a ure function

	d. getSnapshotBeforeUpdate
	Note: child getSnapshotBeforeUpdate will be invoked
	e. componentDidUpdate
	
c. destruction
d. error:
   a. com
